### RMI Example

This is a sample project I did for the university to practise the use of RMI.

Here is a model to illustrate the general purpose of the project:

#simple request-reply

On the master branch you can find the simple model, that implements the server-client communication based on basic request-reply via RMI.

#request-reply with call-by-reference

On the RMIbyReference branch the same project is realized but the entities are called by reference.

#request-callback

The implementation of the request-callback idea can be found on the RMIrequestCallback branch.
